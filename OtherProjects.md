# Other projects

There exists a huge amount of music players. Here is a list of some and other related projects. This list is not meant to be complete - but rather to be interesting in the scope of this project. This means a focus on Open Source, sound quality, platform independence, advanced DJ features, advanced queuing systems, etc.

## Music players

### [Decibel](http://decibel.silent-blade.org/)

* Interesting small project. I found it because there is a [same-named proprietary player for OSX](http://sbooth.org/Decibel/) from the same [person](https://github.com/sbooth) who also developed [Play](#play).

### [Play](http://sbooth.org/Play/)

* [Open Source](https://github.com/sbooth/Play), MacOSX only, ObjC mostly.
