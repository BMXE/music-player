# Other projects

There exists a huge amount of music players. Here is a list of some and other related projects. This list is not meant to be complete - but rather to be interesting in the scope of this project. This means a focus on Open Source, sound quality, platform independence, advanced DJ features, advanced queuing systems, etc.

## Music players

### [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/)

* Open Source, based on KDE, ports are too limited.
* It was my preferred player on Linux.

### [Clementine](https://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/)

* Open Source, forked Amarok, made cross platform.

### [Songbird](http://getsongbird.com/)

* Open Source, based on Mozilla XULRunner + GStreamer.
* Too slow / bloated. Huge amount of problems.
* Project dead since 2013?

### [Banshee](http://banshee.fm/)
