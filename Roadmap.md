# Roadmap

Optimize, either by reimplemtation in C or see below (via static compiling Python):
- binstruct.py
- songdb.py
- guiCocoa.py / guiCocoaCommon.py (aready WIP)
- maybe itunes.py and others
- etc.

On the DB (songdb.py):
- Separate DB low level stuff and Song/MusicPlayer stuff. We want to use the DB also outside.
